# Changelog

All notable changes to Ultimate Debloat Pack are listed here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.12] - 2026-11-07

### Fixed

- **Win11Debloat and Bulk Crap Uninstaller failed with "The term 'Get-FileHash' is not recognized" on some Windows builds** (seen on Windows 11 build 26300). In Windows PowerShell, `Get-FileHash` is a script function of a Windows module rather than a built-in command, and that build does not have it. UDP and the one-liner's `Get.ps1` now calculate SHA256 checksums with .NET directly, which works on every Windows version. The same problem also stopped the Win11Debloat app list from loading at start-up.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-11-07

### Fixed

- **The privacy extensions on the browser page are readable.** Each one now says what it does, for example "uBlock Origin Lite: blocks ads and trackers", instead of showing its store ID in brackets, which looked like random letters. The ID still appears when you point at an extension, and in the log.
- **No more ticked-but-greyed extensions.** When "Install privacy extensions" is unticked, the extension list and its explanation are hidden. Before, the extensions stayed ticked but greyed out, as if they would be installed.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-11-05

### Changed

- The disclaimer (README and welcome page) no longer asks you to test UDP in a virtual machine first. It still says that UDP changes system settings, that it creates a restore point first, and that some changes cannot be undone by UDP itself. The "I agree" checkbox no longer mentions a VM snapshot.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **A short start command and a website.** Start UDP with `irm https://hamiddidnoteat.github.io/udp | iex`, or visit https://hamiddidnoteat.github.io for the command (with a copy button), screenshots and links. The short command loads the same `Get.ps1` from this repository, so the download is still checked against the release's `SHA256SUMS`.

### Changed

- The README, the release notes and `Get.ps1` show the short command. The long GitHub command still works.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **Before/after report.** When a run starts, UDP measures the PC: running processes, RAM in use, running services, startup entries, desktop programs, Store apps and free disk space. After the restart it opens once by itself (a one-time task at the next sign-in that removes itself), waits until Windows has settled, measures again and shows what changed. Reports are saved in `%ProgramData%\UDP\reports` (JSON and text).
- The summary page has an option to turn the report off.
- The welcome page shows when UDP last ran, with a button to open its report, and explains why `%ProgramData%\UDP\state.json` must not be deleted.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **The new browser becomes the default for every link and file type it registers** (for example http, https, .html, .pdf, .svg, .webp), not only for web links. UDP uses Windows' default associations policy (the method documented for organisations) with every association marked `Suggested`, so Windows applies it once, at the next sign-in, and you can still choose other default apps later.
- A clear explanation on the browser page of how the taskbar and default apps options work, and how to remove them.
- Available on Windows 11 22H2 or later, on Pro, Enterprise and Education. On Windows Home, or with the option unticked, UDP opens Settings > Default apps as before.
- "Revert browser policies created by UDP" also removes this policy.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **Edge is replaced by the new browser on the taskbar.** UDP sets the taskbar layout policy built into Windows (the method documented for organisations): Edge's pin is removed, and File Explorer, the new browser and the Microsoft Store are pinned. Windows applies it at the next sign-in. Every pin can still be unpinned, and Windows does not put it back.
- Available on Windows 11 24H2 from build 26100.4484, 22H2/23H2 from build 22621/22631.5549, and later. On older versions the option is unavailable.
- "Revert browser policies created by UDP" also removes this taskbar policy.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **Choose which apps Win11Debloat removes.** The Win11Debloat page lists the apps found on this PC, from Win11Debloat's own list in the release that will run, grouped by its recommendation: safe to remove, optional, not recommended. The list starts with Win11Debloat's recommended selection; "Recommended selection" and "Select none" reset it, and apps that are not installed can be shown too. Point at an app to see what it is.
- Recommended settings work with your own app choice: UDP then runs Win11Debloat with `-RunDefaultsLite -RemoveApps -Apps <your list>`.

### Changed

- The custom options no longer include "Remove the default selection of apps" and "Remove the Xbox app and Xbox Game Bar": the app list covers both.
- Microsoft Edge is never offered in the app list. UDP's own Edge removal step handles it.
- Win11Debloat is downloaded and verified once, when UDP starts, and reused for the run.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **Autoruns guide: what is usually safe to switch off** (chat apps and game launchers you open yourself, music apps, unused cloud sync, meeting apps, update checkers of rarely used apps, leftovers) **and what to leave on** (hardware makers' software, security software, anti-cheat, drivers, anything you do not recognise).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-11-05

### Changed

- **Clearer guides before each tool opens.** The guides for ShutUp10++, Bulk Crap Uninstaller, NVCleanstall and Autoruns now have headings, numbered steps, a "Do I need to save?" answer and what to do when you are done. For example, Autoruns has no Save button: unticking an entry is enough.
- The guides are shown formatted (headings, numbered steps, highlighted notes) in a wider panel, and the log folds away while a guide is open.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **Edge removal cleans up Edge's shortcuts.** Once Edge is gone, UDP removes the **Microsoft Edge** shortcuts left on the desktop (yours and the all-users one) and in the Start menu. They only opened a small empty window. Only shortcuts pointing to Edge's `msedge.exe` are removed.
- Running UDP again on a PC where Edge was already removed now cleans up those leftover shortcuts too.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed

- **Edge removal no longer reports "Failed" when Edge was removed.** Edge's own uninstaller keeps running in the background after AveYo's script ends, and UDP checked too early. UDP now waits up to 5 minutes for it to finish, then checks both Edge's entry in *Settings > Apps* and `msedge.exe`. When something is really left, the log says exactly what.
- Terminal colour codes printed by some tools no longer appear as garbage characters in the log.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-05

First public release.

### Added

- **Wizard:** WPF wizard driven by Windows PowerShell 5.1, with a welcome page and disclaimer, one page per tool, a summary, a run page with progress and an embedded log panel, and a results page with a single restart.
- **Runner:** steps run in a background runspace, so the window stays responsive. A failed step asks whether to continue or stop instead of ending the run.
- **Dry-run mode** (`-DryRun` or the welcome-page checkbox).
- **Restore point** before any change. System Protection on the system drive is switched on if needed, and the 24-hour restore point limit is handled.
- **Steps:** Win11Debloat (recommended defaults or custom options, never `-ForceRemoveEdge`), O&O ShutUp10++ (its own window, or silent with your exported file), Bulk Crap Uninstaller (interactive, run once or keep installed), alternative browser (Firefox, Chrome or Brave, optional privacy extensions through the `ExtensionSettings` policy, with a revert option), Edge removal with AveYo's script (WebView2 always kept), NVCleanstall (NVIDIA GPUs only) and Autoruns.
- **`config/tools.json`:** the single file with every source, winget ID, expected signer and integrity method.
- **Verification:** Authenticode signer checks for signed tools; SHA256 checks for Win11Debloat (release `SHA256SUMS`), Bulk Crap Uninstaller (GitHub asset digest) and the pinned Edge removal script.
- **Launchers:** `Run-UDP.bat`, and `Get.ps1` for the one-liner, which verifies the release zip against its `SHA256SUMS`.
- **Repository:** logo, README with badges, contributing guide, security policy, code of conduct, issue and pull request templates, test workflow on every push, and release notes taken from this changelog.
- **Documentation:** one page per tool, order of operations and an undo guide.
- **Tests:** `tests/Test-UDP.ps1` checks syntax, encoding, config, XAML, online compatibility and a headless dry run.

### Known issues

Found during the first virtual machine test, planned for the next releases:

- Edge removal can report "Failed" although Edge was removed: the result is checked before Edge's own uninstaller has finished.
- Edge shortcuts (desktop, Start menu) stay behind after Edge removal and open an empty window.
